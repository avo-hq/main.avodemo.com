# A word of caution: It's easy to overdo a global singleton like Current and tangle your model as a result.
# Current should only be used for a few, top-level globals, like account, user, and request details.
# The attributes stuck in Current should be used by more or less all actions on all requests.
# If you start sticking controller-specific attributes in there, you're going to create a mess.

class Current < ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes
  attribute :account
  attribute :user
