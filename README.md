### Visit the live app on [avodemo.herokuapp.com](https://avodemo.herokuapp.com/)

This is a demo app to show how simple it is to integrate [Avo](https://avohq.io) in your app.

Have a look at the [/avo](/app/avo) directory to find the resources, filters and actions.

### Install locally

This should be a pretty straighforward Rails install. The app has seeds and everything it needs.

```bash
bundle install

bin/rails db:setup

bin/rails serve
```
